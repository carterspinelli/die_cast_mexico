## How Email Forwarding Works

1. User fills out contact form on your website
2. reCAPTCHA verification ensures legitimate submissions
3. Form data is sent to your Formspree endpoint (`movwqzpr`)
4. Formspree forwards the email to your configured email address
5. User sees success message confirming their message was sent

## Form Fields Sent to Formspree
- **name**: Full name of the contact
- **email**: Contact's email address
- **phone**: Phone number (optional)
- **company**: Company name (optional)
- **message**: Main message content
- **g-recaptcha-response**: reCAPTCHA verification token

2. Fill out the form with valid information
3. Complete the reCAPTCHA verification
4. Submit the form
5. Verify success message appears

### On Production Site

2. Check your configured email address for received messages
3. Verify reCAPTCHA is working properly

## Deployment Requirements

To activate the email forwarding on your production site:
